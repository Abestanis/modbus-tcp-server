A thread-based MODBUS TCP server for testing purposes.

# Installation

Just type 

```bash
pip install modbus-tcp-server
```

And to run it

```bash
modbus-tcp-server 127.0.0.1
```

Just run it without any arguments to see the command line.

# Limitations

It does only the commands related to reading and writing
analog inputs, discrete inputs, holding registers and coils,
so only commands 1-6 and 15-16 are supported.

Also, it spawns a thread per a client. This might be unacceptable to you,
however it can also with with gevent.

# Custom data provider

To implement a custom data provider, just extend
[BaseDataSource](modbus_tcp_server/data_source/base.py) 
to provide data of your choosing and launch it that way: 

```python
from modbus_tcp_server.network import AcceptThread
from modbus_tcp_server.data_source import BaseDataSource

class CustomDB(BaseDataSource):
    ...

c_db = CustomDB()

at = AcceptThread('0.0.0.0', 502, c_db).start()
```

Note that since everything is handled in a single thread, 
if your reads or writes take too long this will hang on them.
File a Issue if you've got a problem with that.
